# Woocommerce Shipping EU Flat Rate

Adds a new international flat rate shipping method to WooCommerce


## Features

* Same features and settings as the WooCommerce default International Delivery
  shipping method.
* The method ID is eu_delivery, as it is intended to define a second international
  shipping zone just for Europe, and use the WooCommerce default international
  flat rate for the "rest of the world".


## How to install

* Download the plugin as zip archive and then upload it to your wordpress plugins
  folder and extract it there.
* Activate the plugin from your admin panel.
